# Final-Internship-Project
This project was some kind of "final exam" after four months of intense courses I have been attending as part of the internship/training program.

This project was some kind of "final exam" after four months of intense courses I have been attending as part of the internship/training program.
At the beginning of the course I knew some very basic things, didn't even know what spring actually is... We had ten working days for it.
It is actually internal administration application for faculties in Serbia (I put imaginary faculty name: Factulty of Software Engineering).
You can do all of CRUD operations over entities like Professor, Student, Subject, Exam Period... Also there is possibility to add exam and to relate
it to certain Subject, Professor, Exam Period. You can manage professor's engagements on certain subjects.
App is not finished, that's how much I managed to do in two weeks. Since we had only two weeks, our mentors from a company told us to focus
on frontend and backend programming. That's why my style is poor.
